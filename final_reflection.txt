I believe that throughout the course I have experienced meaningful growth, both in ability and in how I approach problem-solving. 
I treated this class not just as a series assignment, but an opportunity to engage deeply with material. This was my first course 
after changing majors off something I was unhappy with. I've always enjoyed tech and such things I find fascinating. Often times 
I did research outside of class on seperate topics correlating to my major and have even started a home lab using a VM.

# Attendance and Punctuality

I was consistently present in class, missing no more than 2 sessions. I made it a priority to join the Zoom call on time,
often arriving before the 11:30 AM start to ensure I was ready and attentive. Being punctual wasn't only because it was a requirement 
but rather my main drive was to learn more about python and how I can eventually
incorporate it into my own work in the future.

# Participation and Engagment

I participated in discussion by offering answers when called on. I usually wouldn't have questions because I think the search for the
answer on my own is a great way to retain information. Of course when someone brought up a question in class I would listen attentively.
I found this way of tecahing throughout the course is definitely something I would like to experience in person. I often found myself 
referring back to the live coding repository across all assignments. All of this helped me build a new perspective on learning. I truly 
believe this new found passion changed my life.

# Presence and Focus

I submitted all assignments on time and made sure about meeting due dates. 

# Reflection and Growth + Code Quality

After each assignment, I reviewed the assignment solution and compared them to my own. I didn't just look at what I would incorrectly do, 
but also tried to undertans why I made certain choices and how I oculd improve. For example, when I noticed my code could be written more 
efficiently using different tactics. I also managed to turn type hints into a habbit which I was struggling to do at first. With my code 
quality I believe I met the assignment requirements and rules. I reallly like the segmentation strategy that you use and taught us. It 
makes it way easier to read my code as well as think throughout writing it.

One challenge I encountered very early on was the large amounts of material we learned in the first fe weeks of classes. It was very 
overwhelming at first but saw that it was a necessity. I began to develop better habits because of this. Instead of getting discouraged
I dedicated time outside of class to practice and better my skills. I found myself wanting to do and learn more and more out of fun.

Base on the above, I propose A as my final grade.
