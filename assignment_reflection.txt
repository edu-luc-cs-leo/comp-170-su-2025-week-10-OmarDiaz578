The first thing I noticed immediately is your use of the "or" tool at the start of the fibbonaci_iterative function. 
In my case I wrote code that does the same thing but is spread in more than 5 lines of code while you use less. This 
shows that I can still improve more when writing code. I notice the same thing in the factorial_iterative function.
The range tool used in your code is more efficient than the "while" loop that I used. I believe a great way that I 
can improve on this is by writing code an dthen attempting to rewrite it multiple times in different ways and noticing
their differences and in which way would be better to write.
